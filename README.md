# AccessPi
This is a simple project to configure a Raspberry Pi 2 as a wireless access point with VPN and TOR ready to use.

Please note that all of those are the configuration files and the scripts that I have modified and written. It's not possible to download the code and run it because everything was integrated inside the OS of the Raspberry Pi, with all the installed packages and subdirectories. Of course, you can still read and download everything.

This repository was created for archival and consultation/download purposes only.
